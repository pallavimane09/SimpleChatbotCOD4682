Below is a Java chatbot implementation using the AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) library. AIML allows for natural language processing and enables the chatbot to understand and respond to user queries effectively.

## Java Chatbot Documentation

### Overview
The Java Chatbot is a conversational agent capable of engaging in natural language conversations with users. It utilizes the AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) library to interpret user queries and generate contextually relevant responses. The chatbot aims to provide assistance and information to users in a seamless and interactive manner.

### Features
- Natural Language Understanding: The chatbot employs natural language processing techniques to understand user queries accurately.
- Contextual Responses: Responses provided by the chatbot are contextually relevant to the user's input, enhancing the conversational experience.
- Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the chatbot through a command-line interface, entering queries and receiving responses in real-time.

### Installation
To use the Java Chatbot, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Download the AIML files for the chatbot's knowledge base. These files contain patterns and responses used by the chatbot to interpret user queries and generate responses.
3. Import the AIML library into your Java project.
4. Implement the chatbot class in your project, providing a mechanism for user input and displaying bot responses.
5. Compile and run the program to start interacting with the chatbot.

### Usage
Upon running the Java Chatbot program, users will be prompted to enter their queries. Users can type their queries in natural language, and the chatbot will generate responses based on its knowledge base. The chatbot will continue to interact with users until they enter the command "quit" to exit the conversation.

### Code Explanation
The `Chatbot` class serves as the main entry point for the program. Within the main method, the chatbot initializes by loading AIML files containing its knowledge base. It then enters a loop where it prompts users for input, processes their queries, and generates appropriate responses using the AIML library.

### Execution Examples

### Conclusion
The Java Chatbot provides a user-friendly interface for engaging in conversations and obtaining information. Its use of natural language processing techniques and contextually relevant responses contribute to a seamless user experience. With its interactive interface and ability to understand user queries accurately, the Java Chatbot serves as an effective tool for providing assistance and engaging in conversations.
